# Part 1: Explanatory analysis of the dataset

### Importing the data set

The dataset we will work on is from Canada, and consists of 3987 observations on the following 5 variables:

* `wages`, composite hourly wage rate from all jobs
* `education`, number of years in schooling
* `age`, in years
* `sex`, Male or Female
* `language`, English, French or Other

We will store this data set in a `SLID` dataframe, and remove all rows with incomplete data:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
library(car)
data(SLID, package = "carData")
SLID <- SLID[complete.cases(SLID),]
```

### a) Analyze relationships between some of the variables

First, let's plot a diagnostic plot of all the variables:

```{r, cache = TRUE}
library(GGally)
ggpairs(data = SLID)
```
